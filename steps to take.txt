Add click event to the button to grab value.

create a varible to hold values

if button value is equal sign then, calculate the result.

else add the value to the varible holder

Goal is to:
Click the number adds to the screen

if an operator is clicked then, 
goes to next set of numbers
*maybe just clear the screen*
1 varible max maybe

Calculator Object:
[local] varible to grab the values
[local] maxAmountOfDigit = 10
shape = rectangle
color = black

calculate() return result
defineProperties?


Everytime a button is check the length of the string if value >= 10 stop adding values
